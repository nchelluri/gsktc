                        The aim of the trust is to honor the memory of two remarkable individuals, Gummuluru Sri Krishnaveni (1923-2000) and Thyagaraju Chelluri (1977-2004), by carrying out activities that respect the values they held dear and lived by. One thing they had in common was kindness and a spirit of generosity.

                        <strong>Sri Krishnaveni</strong> was the eldest child of Chelluri Venkata Narasimham and Chelluri Saraswatamma of Chodavaram, Visakhapatnam District in the Andhra region of India. Details of her early childhood are sketchy except that, being the first child of her parents, she was the darling of the family. Not much is known about her girlhood either. What is known is that she got married at a young age and, within a year or so, became a widow, without having had a child. She would have been condemned to a forced ascetic life as was the norm in Brahmin families of the era, depending on a male relative, perhaps a brother, for her survival but for her progressive and forward-looking father. Rescuing her from the indignities of widowhood, he decided that she should get a proper education and be able to stand on her own two feet. Toward that end, he engaged the Hindi teacher at the local high school, Mr. Gouranga Rao, as her tutor. Within a few years, she was able to take the examinations conducted by the Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha in Chennai, a city about five hundred miles away. Eventually, she finished all the requirements except for teacher training, which could be done only in Chennai. After spending a year there undergoing the training, she became eligible to work as a Hindi Pandit, and received her first appointment as a Hindi teacher at St. Mary’s High School for Girls in Visakhapatnam, sometime in the late nineteen forties, perhaps 1947. After working there till 1953, she was transferred to Govt. Girls’ High School in Vizianagaram, where she worked for about twenty years. She was finally transferred back to St. Mary’s High School, and retired there at the mandatory age of 55.

                        The distinguishing features of her personality were a cheerful disposition, a generosity of spirit, and a total lack of self-pity. She educated not only all her siblings, who would otherwise have had absolutely no chance of going to college, but also cousins, nephews and nieces. Moreover, she used to help poor students who were totally unrelated. In a way, they were all her children. And she did all this on her salary as a school teacher! Even in retirement, when she lived in the ancestral house in Chodavaram, she would go to the local schools and encourage poor deserving girls by offering small scholarships. As if this were not enough, she also took care of an elderly aunt and, later, an uncle.

                        <strong>Thyagaraju</strong>, known to family and friends simply as Raju, was the first child of Chelluri C.A. Sastri and Chelluri Parvati. He was born on December 18, 1977 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. He was a happy and mischievous child with bright eyes; it was easy to guess that he would be a very intelligent kid. And so he turned out to be. By the time he was of school-going age, the family had moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and that's where he had his schooling except for Grade 4, which he did in Ithaca, NY, USA, where his father spent a year on sabbatical leave. He thoroughly enjoyed that year -- not just the school, where he was one of the top students, but also extracurricular activities such as Karate, Scouts, violin, and swimming. He also had plenty of friends as well as his little brother Narsimham (Narsa) to play with. It was with reluctance that he returned to Halifax at the end of the year. As he passed through elementary, junior high, and high school, his passions became more and more sharply defined: mathematics, music, and chess. (He played soccer in the summer and went swimming occasionally.) In chess, he was the provincial champion in Grades 9 and 10 and represented Nova Scotia at the National Championships. He loved the game so much that he would spend six, seven hours at a time analyzing the games of the masters and would say he wanted to make his living as a chess player. He also loved mathematics and music immensely -- he used to play Jazz on the saxophone -- but when it was pointed out that it is extremely hard to excel in three different areas simultaneously and that he would be better off focusing on just two of them, he listened, and decided to concentrate on mathematics and music. He never played chess competitively again. But mathematics -- he just loved it. Indeed, he was besotted with it: whenever he came home from college for holidays, after dinner, around 9 or 9:30, he would clear the table and spread his math papers and books and, arming himself with a glass of Coke -- that was his one vice -- and some popcorn, he would start doing mathematics into the wee hours of the morning, sometimes till six. When he was asked why he worked so hard, instead of relaxing during the vacation, he would smile and say that mathematics was a form of entertainment for him and that he really enjoyed the work he did. And he used to play his saxophone for one hour every day without fail until he became ill, at which time he did it only sporadically.

                        He did very well as an undergraduate at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, the place where he had studied Grade 4. He was a member of the Cornell Jazz Band throughout his undergraduate days. More details about his stay at Cornell can be found on the <a href="http://pi.math.cornell.edu/m/Colloquia/Chelluri">Chelluri Lecture page</a>.

                        Raju went to graduate school at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and he did quite well there also. He specialized in analytic number theory, and his supervisor, Henryk Iwaniec, a world-renowned number theorist, thought highly of him and had every expectation that he would do something fundamental. Unfortunately, however, while he was working on his thesis -- he was twenty-five years old then -- Raju was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (Bipolar I), and things started to go downhill rapidly. He was heavily medicated and suffered greatly not only because of the powerful up-down swings caused by the illness but also because of the strong side effects of his medication. On top of all that was the pressure associated with finishing the thesis. The forces that pulled him down were so powerful that they led to his demise at the cruelly young age of 26, on August 21, 2004. He was awarded the Ph.D degree posthumously.

                        What was Raju like? First of all, he was fiercely honest, but he was also gentle, mild, and very shy. Up until the time he became ill, he was a happy, easygoing guy. He had a wonderful smile, and a fine sense of humor. He enjoyed jokes and humorous writing and would himself sometimes tell jokes. He couldn't bear to see anyone suffer -- not just human beings but animals or even insects. He had a strong sense of justice, and even though he was only a graduate student, he gave money regularly  to Doctors Without Borders and  Amnesty International and worked as a volunteer for Amnesty, writing letters, even while  ill, urging heads of state to release political prisoners. In short, to put it in Bertrand Russell's words, he possessed the twin virtues of clear thinking and kindness.
